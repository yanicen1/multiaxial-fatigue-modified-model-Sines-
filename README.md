# Extension of the Sines method (Sines++)

<p>Multiaxial fatigue is a general term that may be used to describe loading and/or loading plus geometry conditions resulting in complex states of stresses and strains, either locally or globally. More specifically, multiaxial loading will result in a state of stress and/or strain, which manifests as two or more components in the stress or strain tensor. An example of a stress tensor resulting at the surface of a component experiencing externally applied normal force, coupled with an externally applied toque.</p>

<p>In order to describe the multiaxial high cycle fatigue behavior of materials, one was proposed the modified Sines method (Sines++) [1].</p>

<p>where <i>I<sub>2a</sub></i> and <i>I<sub>2m</sub></i> are the amplitude and the mean value of the second invariant of the stress deviator tensor, <i>I<sub>1m</sub></i> and <i>I<sub>1a</sub></i> are the amplitude and the mean value of the first invariant of the stress tensor.</p>
<p>The the model parameters A, B, С and D were determined as follows:</p>
