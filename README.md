# Extension of the Sines method (Sines++)

<p>Multiaxial fatigue is a general term that may be used to describe loading and/or loading plus geometry conditions resulting in complex states of stresses and strains, either locally or globally. More specifically, multiaxial loading will result in a state of stress and/or strain, which manifests as two or more components in the stress or strain tensor. An example of a stress tensor resulting at the surface of a component experiencing externally applied normal force, coupled with an externally applied toque.</p>

<p>In order to describe multiaxial high cycle fatigue behavior, one was proposed the modified Sines method (Sines++).</p>
